# 12 Languages in 2024

As part of my developer goals, there have been quite a few languages I've been meaning to learn thoroughly for a while now (I work way too much with plain, vanilla JS). Plus, I've always wanted to move beyond the borders of web development and gain a more general respect for programming overall - and the onset of 2024 is the perfect opportunity to accomplish this.

Starting in January, I'll be spinning a random wheel of 12 languages that I've handpicked (not any definitive list, just a bunch that I've been meaning to explore for a while) to learn for the coming year; each month, I'll add a new one to my toolkit.

The best way to learn a language quickly isn't to watch a bunch of tutorials, it's to get in there and start building something immediately. Hence, each month's folder will be updated regularly with small example programs and larger checkpoint programs to make sure that I get as much bang into my month as possible. I'll also be making a final project to "prove" my newfound skills. If you're interested in the exact day-by-day playthrough, I've included it under `schedule.txt`.

Enough of me talking, let's get into the calendar.
